## HyperText Markup Language describe word by word

Hyper: This prefix means "over" or "above," indicating that it goes beyond the normal text. In the context of HTML, "Hyper" refers to the concept of hyperlinks, which allow users to navigate between different web pages or sections of a page by clicking on text or other elements.

Text: This refers to the content that is displayed on the web page. In HTML, "text" is any content (including words, numbers, symbols, etc.) that appears to users in a readable format.

Markup: This refers to the use of tags to "mark up" or annotate the text to define its structure and presentation on a web page. In HTML, markup involves using tags like <p> for paragraphs, <h1> for headings, <a> for links, etc., to specify how different parts of the text should be formatted and displayed in a browser.

Language: This indicates that HTML is a form of communication used to instruct web browsers on how to display content. It's a "language" because it has its own syntax and rules that browsers understand and interpret to render web pages correctly.

### meta charset="UTF-8" Explain?

The meta charset="UTF-8" tag in HTML specifies the character encoding for the webpage. Here's a breakdown of its components and meaning:

meta: This is an HTML tag used to provide metadata about the HTML document. Metadata is data about data, and in the context of HTML, it includes information about the webpage such as the character set, author, description, and keywords.

charset: This attribute of the meta tag stands for "character set." It defines the character encoding that should be used by the browser to correctly interpret and display the text content of the webpage.

UTF-8: This is a type of character encoding (Universal Character Set Transformation Format - 8-bit). UTF-8 is the most widely used character encoding on the web because it can represent every character in the Unicode character set. This includes characters from almost all writing systems in the world, such as Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese, and many others, as well as various symbols and emojis.

Meaning of meta charset="UTF-8":
By including <meta charset="UTF-8"> in the HTML document, you are instructing the browser to use UTF-8 encoding to interpret the webpage's content. This ensures that the text is displayed correctly, regardless of the language or symbols used on the page. Using UTF-8 helps avoid problems with character display, such as garbled text or incorrect symbols, especially for web pages with international or multilingual content.
