### css mening word by word

Cascading:

The term cascading refers to the way CSS applies styles to HTML elements. In CSS, "cascading" means that multiple style rules can apply to the same element, and the rules are applied in a specific order or hierarchy.

Style:

Style in CSS refers to the rules that define how HTML elements are displayed. These rules include properties like color, font size, margin, padding, border, and many more that determine the appearance of web page elements.
Styles are defined using CSS properties (like color, font-size, background-color) and assigned specific values (like red, 16px, #ffffff).

Sheets:

Sheets refer to the fact that CSS rules are typically written in a separate file (called a style sheet) that is linked to or embedded in an HTML document. This external or internal sheet contains the styling rules that apply to one or more HTML documents.
By using style sheets, you can centralize and manage the styling of multiple web pages more efficiently, maintaining consistency across a website.
