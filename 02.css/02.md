### css mening word by word

Cascading:

The term cascading refers to the way CSS applies styles to HTML elements. In CSS, "cascading" means that multiple style rules can apply to the same element, and the rules are applied in a specific order or hierarchy.

Style:

Style in CSS refers to the rules that define how HTML elements are displayed. These rules include properties like color, font size, margin, padding, border, and many more that determine the appearance of web page elements.
Styles are defined using CSS properties (like color, font-size, background-color) and assigned specific values (like red, 16px, #ffffff).

Sheets:

Sheets refer to the fact that CSS rules are typically written in a separate file (called a style sheet) that is linked to or embedded in an HTML document. This external or internal sheet contains the styling rules that apply to one or more HTML documents.
By using style sheets, you can centralize and manage the styling of multiple web pages more efficiently, maintaining consistency across a website.

### What are the attribute selectors?

CSS attribute selectors allow you to select HTML elements based on the presence or value of a specific attribute. These selectors are very powerful because they enable you to apply styles to elements dynamically based on attributes and their values, such as id, class, href, type, data-\* attributes, and more.

Types of Attribute Selectors
[attribute]
Selects elements with the specified attribute, regardless of its value.

/_ Selects all elements with a `data-info` attribute _/
[data-info] {
color: blue;
}
[attribute="value"]
Selects elements with the specified attribute and an exact value.

/_ Selects all elements with an `type` attribute of exactly "text" _/
[type="text"] {
border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
[attribute~="value"]
Selects elements with the specified attribute whose value is a whitespace-separated list of words and matches one of the words exactly.

/_ Selects elements with a `class` attribute containing the word "button" _/
[class~="button"] {
background-color: yellow;
}
This is useful for class names where multiple classes can be assigned to a single element.

[attribute|="value"]
Selects elements with the specified attribute whose value is either exactly value or starts with value followed by a hyphen (-). This is commonly used for language attributes.

/_ Selects all elements with a `lang` attribute that is either "en" or starts with "en-" _/
[lang|="en"] {
color: green;
}
[attribute^="value"]
Selects elements with the specified attribute whose value begins with the specified value.

/_ Selects all elements with a `href` attribute that starts with "https" _/
[href^="https"] {
text-decoration: underline;
}
[attribute$="value"]
Selects elements with the specified attribute whose value ends with the specified value.

/_ Selects all elements with a `src` attribute that ends with ".jpg" _/
[src$=".jpg"] {
border: 2px solid red;
}
[attribute="value"]\*
Selects elements with the specified attribute whose value contains the specified value (anywhere within the value string).

/_ Selects all elements with a `class` attribute that contains "nav" anywhere in the value _/
[class*="nav"] {
font-weight: bold;
}
